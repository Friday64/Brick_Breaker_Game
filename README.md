Install Python 3.12.2:

Ensure you have Python 3.12.2 installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Set up a virtual environment:

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Navigate to your project directory and run the following commands:
sh
Copy code
python3.12 -m venv venv
On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

With your virtual environment activated, install the dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Save the game code:

Save your game code in a file called brick_breaker.py.
Run the game:

With the virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, run the game using:
sh
Copy code
python brick_breaker.py
Directory Structure
Your project directory should look like this:

Copy code
project_directory/
│
├── brick_breaker.py
├── requirements.txt
└── venv/
Following these steps will set up your environment and allow you to run your Brick Breaker game. If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to ask!
