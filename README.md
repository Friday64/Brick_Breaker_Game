# Brick Breaker Game

Currently in Development: Brick Breaker game with pygame built in physics library.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.12.2 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org).

### Set up a Virtual Environment:

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Navigate to your project directory and run the following command:

```sh
python3.12 -m venv venv
```
On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

### Install dependencies:

With your virtual environment activated, install the dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With the virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, run the game using:

```sh
python brick_breaker.py
```

### Directory Structure
Your project directory should look like this:

```
project_directory/
│
├── brick_breaker.py
├── requirements.txt
└── venv/
```
Following these steps will set up your environment and allow you to run your Brick Breaker game. If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to ask!
